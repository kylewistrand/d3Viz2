# d3Viz2
This is a chart made in D3 as a midterm assignment for my Information Visualization class (INFO 441) at the University of Washington.

The assignment was to imitate this chart in D3, which was originally built with Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.newman#!/vizhome/shared/NSJ8WB8H7

**View the replicated version I built using D3 here: https://kylewistrand.github.io/d3Viz2/**

I acquired the data by downloading the Tableau file and saving the CSV file that was used in this viz separately. I did do a bit of cleaning on the CSV to remove some strange characters that were in there for some reason.

## Comparison
Can you tell which one is the original and which one is mine?
